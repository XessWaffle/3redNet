# 3redNet
A neural network for 3 dimensional layered images built from the ground up using NVidia's CUDA libraries

Last in a series of neural network projects completed by me including:
- Molecular alignment modeling using neural networks.
- MNIST image identification using a novel neural network architecture.
- Boolean function approximation of a novel neural network architecture.

The above can be seen in some of my other repositories
